## The information about the location where PokÃ©mon appeared
###################################################################################
### "rural","midurban","suburban","urban" (boolean variable) -> defines the population density
### latitude, longitude (continous variable) -> included in appeared Local time
### gymInXm (boolean variable) -> defines if the distance from a gym is greater than a value
### gymDistanceKm (continous variable) -> defines the distance from a gym
### pokestopInX (boolean variable) -> defines if the distance from a pokestop is greater than a value
### pokestopDistanceKm (boolean variable) -> defines the distance from a pokestop
